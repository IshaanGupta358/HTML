                <h3><p>Strong and unique passwords are vital in cyber safety because they serve as the first line of defense against unauthorized access to your accounts and sensitive information. Cybercriminals often use techniques like brute force attacks and password guessing to gain access to accounts with weak passwords. By using strong and unique passwords for each online account, you significantly reduce the risk of being a victim of hacking or identity theft. Password managers can help you generate and store complex passwords securely, making it easier to maintain a high level of security across your digital accounts.</p></h3>

                <b><h2>2)What is phishing, and how can I protect myself from it?</h2></b>
                <h3>Phishing is a type of cyberattack where attackers impersonate legitimate entities (like banks, government agencies, or trusted companies) to trick individuals into revealing personal information, such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details. To protect yourself from phishing, be cautious when clicking on links or opening email attachments from unknown sources. Always verify the sender's email address and avoid sharing sensitive information via email. Regularly update your email filters and use antivirus software to detect and block phishing attempts. Additionally, consider enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible to add an extra layer of security to your accounts.</h3>

            <b><h2>3)What should I do if my personal information is compromised in a data breach?</h2></b>
            <h3 id="con">If your personal information is compromised in a data breach, take immediate action to minimize potential harm. Start by changing the passwords for the affected accounts and enabling 2FA. Monitor your financial statements for any suspicious activity and consider placing a fraud alert on your credit reports. Be cautious of unsolicited communications, as cybercriminals may attempt to exploit the breach further. It's also a good practice to inform the relevant authorities and report the breach to the affected service provider, as they may take steps to mitigate the breach's impact and enhance their security measures. Finally, stay vigilant by regularly checking your accounts for unusual activity and keeping an eye on your credit reports for any signs of identity theft.
