 <h3><p>A Trojan Horse (Trojan) is a type of malware that disguises itself as legitimate code or software. Once inside the network, attackers are able to carry out any action that a legitimate user could perform, such as exporting files, modifying data, deleting files or otherwise altering the contents of the device. Trojans may be packaged in downloads for games, tools, apps or even software patches. Many Trojan attacks also leverage social engineering tactics, as well as spoofing and phishing, to prompt the desired action in the user.</p></h3></h3>
